# Dog-Breed-API-Practice-Week-6
Dog Breed Image Generator App
* initial application: Random Dog Image Generator
* Updated Application: Select Dog Breed then Generate Image based off the selected breed
  
* Instructions: Find an API on Github that appeals to you https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis Using postman and reading the docs, figure out how to call 1-2 endpoints Create a html and js file and fetch the data from one endpoint. Using the data from the json body, update and display it on your html page

* Notes: App will fetch the list of all breeds from another endpoint and populate a <select> dropdown, so I can pick a breed and then fetch its image, rather than random image generation (first version i made using only one endpoint)
